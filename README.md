COM559 | Major Project Website and Game

A small game created within Unity, with C#, Javascript with the ability of posting high scores through C#, PHP and MySQL. A standalone single page site also exists within.

This project was created for final year IMD at Ulster University, Jordanstown. Some code at times may not be completely correct, however feel free to leave comments, any little helps!
Finally, when the game is finished, please feel free to download and give it a test! Feel free to take any scripts that are of use.

Assets found within the game at present, are not mine to own.

Kind regards,
Gareth.
